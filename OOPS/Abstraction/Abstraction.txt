Data Abstraction:
-----------------
    -> Data Abstraction is used to hide irrelevent details from the user and show the details that are relevent
       to the users.
    -> Hiding complex implementation details while just showing oe exposing essential information and functionalities to users.
    -> In python we can achieve data abstraction by using abstract classes and abstract classes can be created 
       using abc(abstract base class) module and abstract method of abc class.

Abstract Class:
---------------
    -> Abstract class is a class in which one or more abstract methods are defined.
    -> When a method is defined inside the class without its implementation is known as abstract method.

Abstract Method:
----------------
    -> Abstract method is not a default feature. To create abstract method and abstract classes 
       we need to import "ABC" and "abstractmethod" from abc library.
    -> Abstract method of the base class force its child class to write implementation of all the abstract methods 
       defined in base class. if not implemented it will throw error.

Concrete Method:
----------------
    -> Concrete methods are defined in an abstract base class with their complete implementation. These are required to avoid reprication of code in subclasses.
    -> These are created in abstract classes if all of its child classes are having same implementation.

Access Specifiers:
------------------
    1) Public: 
            -> The members of a class that are declared public are easily accessible from any part of the program. 
               All data members and member functions of a class are public by default.
               Eg:- self.a
    2) Protected:
            -> The members of a class that are declared protected are only accessible to a class derived from it. 
               Data members of a class are declared protected by adding a single underscore ‘_’ symbol before the data member of that class.
               But in python public and protected can be accessed from any part of the program (but it is a conviction not a rule in python, 
               if you declare it as a protected then don't use out side the class except in it's subclass)
               Eg:- self._a
    3) Private:
            -> The members of a class that are declared private are accessible within the class only, private access modifier is the most secure access modifier. 
               Data members of a class are declared private by adding a double underscore ‘__’ symbol before the data member of that class. 
               But in python there is a way to access these called name mangling (object._classname__varibalename)
               Eg:- self.__a
