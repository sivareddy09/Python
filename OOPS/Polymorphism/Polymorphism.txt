The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators 
with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

There are ways to write:
1. Duck Typing
2. Method Overloading
3. Operator Overloading
4. Method Overriding

1. Duck Typing
---------------
    -> It is used basically, because it allows the data types to be dynamic.
    -> Python it self is a dynamically typed language.
    -> It will check for the method is present or not for the class you are calling.

    For Coding Example refer -> DuckTyping.py file


3. Operator Overloading
-----------------------
    -> Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined meaning.
    -> As '+' operator can add two values either they are both integers or strings or floats or mix of them like one integer and one string vice versa.
    -> It is acheivable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class.
    -> In another way, If same built-in operator or function that shows different behaviour for objects of different classes is called operator overloading.
