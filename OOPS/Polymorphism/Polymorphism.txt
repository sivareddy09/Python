The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators 
with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

There are ways to write:
1. Duck Typing
2. Method Overloading
3. Operator Overloading
4. Method Overriding

1. Duck Typing
---------------
    -> It is used basically, because it allows the data types to be dynamic.
    -> Python it self is a dynamically typed language.
    -> It will check for the method is present or not for the class you are calling.
