The word "polymorphism" means "many forms", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators 
with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes.

There are ways to write:
1. Duck Typing
2. Method Overloading
3. Operator Overloading
4. Method Overriding

1. Duck Typing
---------------
    -> It is used basically, because it allows the data types to be dynamic.
    -> Python it self is a dynamically typed language.
    -> It will check for the method is present or not for the class you are calling.

    For Coding Example refer -> DuckTyping.py file

2. Method Overloading
---------------------
    -> If one or more methods have the same name but different number of parameters or different types of parameters or both.
    -> In Python method overloading will not be acheived directly. Even if we create multiple methods in same class, 
        it will call the last defined method in the class.
    -> There are other ways to acheive method overloading. But it will be acheived by creating one method.
        1) By giving default value to the parameter.
        2) Using *args as the parameter of the method.
        3) Using multipledispatch python library.

3. Operator Overloading
-----------------------
    -> Operator Overloading means giving extended meaning beyond their predefined meaning.
    -> As '+' operator can add two values either they are both integers or strings or floats or mix of them like one integer and one string vice versa.
    -> It is acheivable because '+' operator is overloaded by int class and str class.
    -> In another way, If same built-in operator or function that shows different behaviour for objects of different classes.

4. Method Overriding
--------------------
    -> Method Overriding is an ability of any OOP language that allows a sub-class to provide specific implementation of a method that is 
        already provided by on of its super-class.
    -> When a method in a sub-class has same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, 
        then it is said to be Override the method in the super-class.
